							<h2>MEMORY LANE</h2>

							<p>Once upon a time there were two girls living in urban parts of India. One living in Jharkhand other living in Uttar pradesh. But the lord almighty had a plan to bring them together. They both got into the same college. Started pursuing same degree in same year. Got hostel room in same corridor. And adding to the list got enrolled into same section. Destined to be together huh? The first time I saw you I was like" is ladki me dressing sense naam ki koi cheez ni h" Like seriously babe classroom me green sut pe dark red lipistick kon lgata h? Chaman chomu kahi ki. lol. BTW you remember the first time I sat with you ? I remember tho. During that time I was with palak and pragya and one day they both were absent and i didn't have any one to sit with also all the seats were filled except the one beside you. So I asked you if I could sit with with you  and you said Yes . We didn't talked that much . You used to hang out with Shivani I guess. I'm not sure but that's all I can recall. We didn't talk much and went back to hostel together. And that was the first time we sat, talked and went to hostel together.</p>
							
							<p>Our first photoshoot- Rumours about your beautiful room was all the way to the downtown. So one day I thought of having a photoshoot there. I went to your room and asked If I can take some pic there and you said yes. That was the first time you took my pictures. Next time you came to my room with Kannu and asked if you can take pictures in my room and I said yes.</p>

							<p>You remeber the first time we shared food? Well I do. You remeber the time when you had that septic on your leg due to spider's bite? And when you recovered you threw a small party. We were wearing jeans and we sneak out of the hostel while other girls were caught by the warden for wearing them. And then we did our little photoshoot. And then we went old market vibing on deep shit post malone's song. Bought some food stuff and went back hostel and then we dig our hands into that small yet big feast and that was the first time we shared food. </p>

							<p>Remmber the time when I told you about gogo? And you slapped me in face for not telling you? Dayum that hurts! Remember the time we having a cold war going on and we stopped talking and exchanging smiles? And one day when I was sick and throwing up you came to my room and rubbed my back. That was the sweetest thing one could do. You remeber the last day college ? Before coming back to home? We were laughing ,gossiping, packing together, everything was so joyous. Remember the time we were travelling in meta from here and there without any reason? Remember the time you wake me up in the morning to go to college? You were literally banging my door in the morning just because you wanted to attend the class to maintain your attendance. And you didn't want to go alone.</p>

							<p> Damn man I miss you so much! Just meet me as soon as possible .</p>
