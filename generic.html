							<h2>A DATE TO BE REMEBERED</h2>
							<p>30.03.2000</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>I know 30th march is an important date but you know what else is a significant date? the day I met you.It's been two years and ever since you eneterd my life it has been more brighter and happier. I don't think I could ever tell how how much you mean to me. Just smjh jao hmko bhot pyar h tumse. </p>

							<p> Although I have known you for two years only. but it feels like I've known you forever. You always know how to chear me up when I'm down. The memories, the laugh, the fun , the moments, I'll never forget them. Of course we have argued ocassionally but I guess that's what friends do, but that has just make us better friends. As long as we live, no matter when or where, if you ever need anything do tell me, because  I'll always be there for you, no matter what.</p>

							<p>I'm not the type of person that will let a friend like you cry yourself to sleep, or cry anytime. I would and I will stay up late  talking about the weirdest things to try to cheer you up. Just always remeber that you are gorgeous , funny, funny,sexy and one of the most amazing person I've ever met.You deserve the world . you desrve lots of happiness. and you better get that. </p>

							<p>In short all I wanna say is that you are really important for me and I never wanna loose you. And I hope you undersytand how important you are to me. so therefore, the day I met you was indeed miraculous . But you see I wouldn't have met you if 30th march 2000 wasn't a date so after doing typical calculations I came on final conclusion that 30th march 2000 is indeed a greatest day of the history. </p>
