							<h2>ALWAYS REMEMBER</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> That women like you are so rare and precious and that I feel truly blessed to have you in my life.You inspire me because you are not afraid to be yourself. And I know you weren’t born that way. I know that life has beaten and bent you. I know it took you a long time to learned to truly love yourself.You had to build your confidence from scratch. But you managed. Somewhere down the line, you realized that it’s not about being perfect—it’s about being you. It’s about accepting yourself.

								You taught me that you don’t always have to be strong. You are allowed to have a meltdown from time to time. You are allowed to break into pieces. That’s OK as long as you keep picking yourself up.
								
								Not giving up on yourself is what it’s all about, and it doesn’t matter how long it takes. It’s the end result that counts.
								
								You inspire me because no matter how many curve balls life threw at you, you always found the moments to smile.
								
								Even in your darkest hour, you keep a positive mind. You always enjoy the small fragments of light that come your way.
								
								You know that there are always some good days just around the corner, waiting for you, waiting for your loved ones, and it’s only a matter of time before you get there.

You transform an ordinary day into extraordinary.

You have a great sense of humor. You can make a whole room laugh without making an actual effort. There is something radiant about you that makes people gravitate to you.

You are intelligent, driven and passionate in whatever you do. When you hit a roadblock, you just keep on persisting until you make it. And I’m lucky just to witness that.

Watching you dream big inspires me to do the same. YOU ARE AMAZING AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH</p>
